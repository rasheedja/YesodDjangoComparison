\section{Meeting 1 - 3rd October 2017}

\subsection{Meeting Notes:}

\subsubsection{Books}

Real World Haskell\\
Haskell from first principles (haskellbook.com)\\
Web application development with Haskell and Yesod (out of date)

\subsubsection{Frameworks / Tools}

Haskell Servant package\\
Snap is alternative to Yesod\\
ghcjs haskell to js\\
haskell stack tool\\
hackage is like npm. Stack can use hackage.\\
Stackage is like stack on top of hackage\\
Use the latest LTS version of haskell from stackage\\
Atom could be useful with their plugins, compare with plugins available for code\\
ghc-mod available for haskell in atom, helpful when developing\\
ide-haskell, linter\\
There is a Haskell plugin for intellij which may work. Good because I would be familiar with the IDE.

\subsubsection{Comparing the two frameworks}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Maintainability
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Make a change to both
  \end{itemize}
  \item Performance
  \item Scalability - could use tools, hard to do on your own
  \item People say Haskell is easier to write code with, less time debugging, once learnt
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We could test this. How much the type checking helps. The different tools available
    \item Can't use line by line debugging
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Plan for next meeting}

Do as much as possible for now\\
Come up with rough project definition form\\
Go through some haskell tutorials, haskellbook.com is recommended
