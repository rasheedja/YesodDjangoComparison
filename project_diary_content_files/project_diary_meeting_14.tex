\section{Meeting 14 - 26th April 2018}

\subsection{Meeting Notes:}


For the networking test where you mention that Django uses more data,
use the network tab on the browser to confirm this. If you load
the site in Yesod, the data loaded is lower and then it's compressed.

Fix lstlisting, set language before code blocks.

When Yesod throws errors, say runtime error, with a compiler message.

texcel, you can use macros. Could make font for code smaller.
Reformat the code blocks to be easier to read.
Any case against the types. Early profile page was one request/view. This meant that
there was some extra Haskell code that had to be written.

Last section, fix typo `Yesod being less resource intensive than Yesod.', wrong
your.

Small section that talks about how you made a functional, actually usable,
site. Site is realistic, which gives us a useful way to evaluate the frameworks.
This could be before the testing method.

Amazon monitoring is only available in five minute intervals (free usage limit).

A refactor at the end would have been useful to evaluate at the end. Does
the more rigid structure of the Haskell program help with refactoring?
Haskell compiler would guide you on what needs to be changed after a
small change.

Conclusion
Summarise the entire report, half a page, a side.

Get rid of some of the more uninteresting website images.

A useful diagram would explain the architecture of each framework.
