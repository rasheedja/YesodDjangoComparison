\section{Meeting 5 - 10th November 2017}

\subsection{Meeting Notes:}

I’ve created the homepages in both yesod and django. I’ve used tests in django to test a basic app not related to the project

Next week, I want to ensure both home pages are the same and to create tests in both frameworks. I want to progress more through the yesod and haskell book.
Create User models in both yesod and django and create tests for them.
