\section{Meeting 9 - 1st February 2018}

\subsection{Meeting Notes:}
Worked mainly on the Django site. I have the messages working and have began comparing features between two sites such as
\begin{itemize}
  \item The implementation of Handlers/Routes
  \item The way you can pass variables to templates
  \item How Haskell's 'maybe' reduces the number of errors you need to catch
  \item the ways you can implement AJAX in both frameworks
\end{itemize}

In the near future, refactor the messages implementation to use AJAX for retrieval of messages and creating new messages. This refactoring will help compare the ease of modifiability of both of these frameworks.\\
Whenever you come across a difficult error, try to compare the process of debugging in both frameworks.\\
Remember to focus on using different parts of the framework than just implementing new features on the site.\\
Try to resolve the textarea problem. If you can't send a screenshot of the error.\\
