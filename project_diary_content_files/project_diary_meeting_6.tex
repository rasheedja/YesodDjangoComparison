\section{Meeting 6 - 16th November 2017}

\subsection{Meeting Notes:}

I’ve created the homepages in yesod and django and ensured that they both have the same content and styling.

For django, I have added the functionality to allow users to create accounts and log in. I have added unit tests for this and they all pass.

For yesod, I have added the latest version of jquery and bootstrap to the project. I have tried to complete the user account functionality but I am blocked. I am trying to import yesod-auth-hashdb but cannot figure out how to do it. There is some documentation showing how to edit the cabal file but this is overwritten during the build, I believe the data comes from package.yml. Editing package.yml causes strange errors when I try to build the project but I don’t think I am doing it in the correct manner. Need to figure out how to edit the package.yml, edits would result in errors on my computer.

For next week, I want to fix the weird error and get some tests up.

Things to try to resolve the error, try to reproduce it on normal ubuntu. If you can’t resolve it, report it to yesod.
