\section{Meeting 11 - 22nd March 2018}

\subsection{Meeting Notes:}
Implemented type safety for some URLs

\begin{itemize}
  \item{How much does it help with testing / debugging?}
  \item{Does this reduce the amount of code you need (to check parameter types, etc.)}
\end{itemize}

Joins cannot be done with Yesod Persistent (alternative pseudo SQL available) but restructuring
logic may be more efficient than joins.

\subsubsection{Plan for the holidays and beyond}
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Finish the functionality of both websites by the end of week 2 of the holidays}
  \item{Produce a report by the end of week 3 of the holidays}
  \item{Get feedback and produce another version of the report the first week back from the holidays}
  \item{Get more feedback and produce a final version of the report the second week after the holidays}
\end{itemize}
