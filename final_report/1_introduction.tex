In this report, we will compare two web frameworks, one written in Haskell and another, more
popular framework, written in a typical object oriented language. To perform the evaluation,
a functionally identical website was created in both frameworks.

One issue that individuals face when looking into Haskell Web frameworks is the lack of
detailed comparisons between these frameworks and more traditional frameworks that these
individuals likely have experience in. This report will provide an in-depth look at the
advantages and disadvantages of choosing to use a Haskell Web Framework, and will help
these individuals come to an informed decision on whether or not a Haskell Web Framework is
best for them.

\section{The Chosen Frameworks}

Yesod is a fully featured and modular web framework written in Haskell. Yesod claims to use
features of the Haskell language to provide a fast, modular, and type safe web framework. By
choosing Yesod as the web framework for the Haskell language, we will be able to determine
whether or not Haskell's type safety, referential transparency, and lazy compiling is an advantage
or a disadvantage for web developers.

\begin{quote}
Yesod attempts to ease the web development process by playing to the strengths of the Haskell 
programming language. Haskell’s strong compile-time guarantees of correctness not only encompass 
types; referential transparency ensures that we don’t have any unintended side effects. Pattern 
matching on algebraic data types can help guarantee we’ve accounted for every possible case. 
By building upon Haskell, entire classes of bugs disappear. \parencite[Introduction]{yesodBook}

Django is a Python Web Framework. Django, like Yesod, is a ``batteries included'' web framework,
``instead of having to open up the language to insert your own power (batteries), you just have
to flick the switch and Django does the rest.'' \parencite{djangoBookReasons}. I chose Django
for a number of reasons

\begin{itemize}
  \item ``Batteries included'', like Yesod
  \item Modular, like Yesod
  \item Python is now more common than PHP, second only to Node.js \parencite{djangoBookReasons}
\end{itemize}

The Django and Yesod web frameworks have a similar set of features. This ensured that we could
make a functionally identical site in both of these frameworks with a similar 
amount of effort. This enables us to make a fair comparison between Django and Yesod, enabling
us to come to a conclusion on whether a Haskell web framework may be a good choice for a 
developer rather than a more tradition web framework.

\section{The Report}

The rest of this report will discuss any pieces of work similar to this project, the process of
writing the code for both frameworks, including any preparation that had to be done, and a detailed
evaluation of the websites that were produced. The evaluation will compare page load speeds,
the reliability and maintainability of the websites, the ease of writing new code, the ease of
debugging issues, the features including in each framework's test suite, and whether the static typing
and type safety of the Haskell language help or hinder the process of developing a website.
