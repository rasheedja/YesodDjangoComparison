\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is this project about?}
The goal of this project is to compare two different frameworks, one written in Haskell and one written in another, more popular framework in an Object Oriented language.

In both of the chosen frameworks, I will write a simple clone of twitter, a social media website. The two websites will be functionally identical to allow a fair comparison between the chosen frameworks. When evaluating the frameworks, I will compare the reliability, maintainability, speed, functionality, and the efficiency of both websites.
